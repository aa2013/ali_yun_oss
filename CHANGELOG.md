#### üì§ Extended Upload Methods
- **Multi-Type Upload Support**: Added convenient upload methods for different data types
  - `putObjectFromString()` - Upload string content with automatic UTF-8 encoding
  - `putObjectFromBytes()` - Upload byte array data directly
  - Maintains full compatibility with existing `putObject()` for file uploads
  - Implemented as extension methods in implementation classes, keeping interfaces clean

### üìö Documentation & Examples
- **Enhanced STS Documentation**: Complete examples for both static and dynamic STS token management
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Added examples for all upload types in `example.dart`
- **README Synchronization**: Ensured complete correspondence between English and Chinese versions

### üß™ Testing & Quality
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added extensive unit tests for new functionality
- **All Tests Passing**: 21/21 tests pass, including new multi-type upload tests
